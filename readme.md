# structsd
**structsd** is the reference client for the Structs consensus network. 

This client is intended primarily for network validators and service providers. Most players within the Structs ecosystem will not need to operate the code in this repository. 

## Structs
In the distant future the species of the galaxy are embroiled in a race for Alpha Matter, the rare and dangerous substance that fuels galactic civilization. Players take command of Structs, a race of sentient machines, and must forge alliances, conquer enemies and expand their influence to control Alpha Matter and the fate of the galaxy.

[Structs](https://playstructs.com) is a decentralized game in the Cosmos ecosystem, operated and governed by our community of players--ensuring Structs remains online as long as there are players to play it.

## Get started
**structsd** is a [Cosmos SDK docs](https://docs.cosmos.network) project being developed with the help of the [Ignite CLI](https://ignite.com/cli). To learn more, see the [Ignite CLI docs](https://docs.ignite.com). 

```
ignite chain serve
```

`serve` command installs dependencies, builds, initializes, and starts your blockchain in development.
